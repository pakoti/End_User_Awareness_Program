# Awareness raising program against cyber threats for end users


This program has been written in order to increase the awareness of the users of organizational networks in order to avoid the dangers and
Be familiar with the threats and the ways to deal with them in order to avoid the threats from the users of the networks
An organization wants to reach the smallest possible size. Perhaps it can be argued that the biggest threat is the most secure network
organizations in the world is the same threat that comes from the network users themselves.


<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>
Today, the biggest threat vector to secure networks are end users who have not received the necessary training
They haven't done it, or they have been trained, but they don't know exactly why these actions are taken
It is pointed out by the network administrators. In this document, why these actions are done in a very simple way for users
Final training will be given.
</p>




<h1>Goals</h1>
<p>
<ul>
<li>1.Increasing the awareness of end users against threats and reducing the vector of organizational threats</li>
<li>2.Better management of security incidents</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The most important vector of security threats to the organization
The threat vectors of corporate networks are many and complex, but those from the user's side
The final entry into the organization is limited to:
<ul>
<li> Social engineering and phishing emails</li>
<li> Two-step authentication and password management</li>
<li> Malware</li>
<li> Internal threats</li>
<li> Network penetration indicators</li>
<li> Security of mobile devices</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
For each of these threats, the end users should see the necessary training, and in general, most of the threats from
They are not outside type.
</p>




<h1>Social engineering and phishing emails</h1>
<p>
You must have heard this expression a lot, if I want to explain it very simply: "What does it mean?
That's how you can trick someone into doing what I want!"
They call you and pretend that you are from the radio or even the TV station and you are the winner of the game
You have been awarded and to receive the award you have to deposit a small amount to someone's personal account
Do it. The strange part of this story is why radio or television should ask us to do it for one
Personal account to deposit money to send us the prize?
This is an interesting part of social engineering that is built on the basis of pretending to be credible. How is this going now?
Can it be dangerous for you as an end user?
Let's examine a scenario together:
You are working in the technical and repair department. An organizational email is intended for you
You receive in the email account outside the company (for example, Gmail) that the IT department of the organization
It asks you to enter this link as soon as possible and enter your email account and password
Read the important email that came from the organization. You enter the link and that's it.....
Now, the attacker pretends to be from the company where you work, and your account and password.
and it will definitely enter your corporate email.
This type of attack can happen to anyone, if you receive this type of email
Inform the IT department of your organization. It is also necessary to comply with the following:
<ul>
<li>
1. The source of received emails should be checked carefully</li>
<li> 2. Avoid sending passwords and bank account information to others via e-mail and even mobile phones</li>
<li>3. Do not open links and attachments of anonymous emails.</li>
<li>4. In case of sending an email to another person, be sure to check the email address carefully.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h1>Password management and two-step authentication</h1>
<p>
Today, passwords have taken the place of keys and locks to some extent in our daily lives. From the second bank password to the email password
and the user account of the sites and...
It can be summarized in a few simple things:
<ul>
<li>. 1. Leave the password on the paper next to the monitor and...</li>
<li>2. Periodically change the passwords of important accounts</li>
<li>3. Enable two-step authentication for email</li>
<li>4. Never share your account passwords with other colleagues</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h1>Malware</h1>

<p>
If we want to talk about malware, books can be written, etc., but let me tell you very briefly
You. Malware is divided into these several classes and sometimes includes all of them:
<ul><li>
<li>.1 cream </li>
<li>.2 virus </li>
3. Ransomware
<li>. 4 adware</li>
<li>.5 Spyware</li>
<li>.6 Trojans </li>
<li>â€¦ .7</li>
</ul>
This list goes on, but this much is enough for the simplicity of the content. In a very brief way for
You will be explained how each one works.
<ul>
<li>
1.Worms: self-replicating programs that transfer copies of themselves from one computer to another without the need for action.
They play human. They consume bandwidth and system resources during propagation and potentially
They cause network congestion and slowness.
</li>
<li>
2. Viruses: Like worms, viruses also reproduce and infect files or applications.
To activate and infect the host computer. However, unlike worms, viruses
usually
Releases require human interaction - such as opening an email attachment or downloading an infected file.
</li>
3. Ransomware: Malware that encrypts files or locks a computer until the victim
Pay the ransom to unlock it. It often exploits vulnerabilities in old software
It enters through social engineering techniques such as phishing emails.
</li>
<li>4. Adware: software designed to display unwanted advertisements, usually in a program or window
browser. Some adware are legitimate, but others are deceptive tactics
they use for their secret installation, bombarding users with annoying pop-up windows
or even change the main pages of the browser.
</li>
<li>5.Spy software: surveillance software that monitors online activity, pressing keyboard buttons, passwords or
Controls the user's personal information. Like many other malware, spyware
They often hide their presence and make detection difficult.</li>
<li>6.Trojans: malicious programs that are disguised as benign software and as something
They appear useful or interesting to trick victims into installing them. After installation, Trojans can
steal sensitive data, corrupt files or compromise remote access to hackers
Drop more systems in the same network.</li>
</ul>
<p>
They are not exclusive, and modern malware often has multiple features or behaviors from one or more of these categories
in turn
Combines several classes. Antivirus solutions from signatures, behavior analysis and models
They use machine learning to identify and neutralize threats. Keep the software up to date
Your security is critical to protecting against evolving cyber attacks.

<h1>Threats within the organization</h1>
<p>
This form of threats has a more human form and the actions are carried out by the employees themselves. Example of contamination
Deliberately destroying devices or intentionally destroying company data or even disclosing organizational information. This form
Threats also have the ability to bypass important defensive barriers and can be the cause of all the managers' efforts
Destroy corporate networks overnight.
Investigating how to respond to this type of threats is very long
It is enough that this form of threats can be identified and answered.
To deal with the type of threat you, as an end user, observe these few things:
<ul><li>
<li>. 1. Do not share your system password with anyone.</li>
<li>. 2. Don't enter someone's personal system without their permission.</li>
<li>3. Do not ask anyone for a password and do not give your password to anyone.</li>
<li> 4. If you see any suspicious activity, inform.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Network penetration indicators</h1>
<p>
When you first log into your account on the corporate network, what you see is one
The background image is black or red, or your computer is too slow or the programs are too sudden
They open and close in your system...
These signs may indicate an intrusion into your system!
In this case, just inform the IT unit of your organization!
</p>



<h1>Security of mobile devices</h1>
<p>
Today, mobile phones and tablets have become inseparable parts of organizations. Almost all security matters
which is for desktop and laptop systems also apply to this kind of devices. A few points
In addition to these points, it must be observed. Example
<ul>
<li>. 1. Do not share the Wi-Fi password of the corporate network with anyone.</li>
<li>2. Do not download programs from unknown and unreliable sources.</li>
<li>. 3. Keep your system up to date.</li>
</ul>
</p>
